Training Module: Using PyCharm with GitHub Copilot

Introduction
This module introduces GitHub Copilot to intermediate-level Python developers who use PyCharm as their primary coding environment. You will learn how to set up Copilot, explore its features, and practise with coding challenges. By the end, you will understand how to use Copilot effectively and evaluate its suggestions for correctness.

Part 1: Setting Up GitHub Copilot in PyCharm
Prerequisites

A GitHub account with an active Copilot subscription.
PyCharm installed (Professional or Community edition).

Part 2: Key Features of GitHub Copilot
Real-Time Code Suggestions: Copilot provides inline suggestions as you type.
Code Completion: Use Tab or Ctrl+Enter to accept or cycle through suggestions.
Multi-Line Suggestions: Copilot can generate entire functions or blocks of code based on comments or partial inputs.
Context Awareness: Suggestions adapt to the structure and style of your codebase.

Part 3: Hands-On Exercises: Coding Challenges
Challenge 1: Basic Algorithm

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Add a comment, # Function to calculate factorial, and observe Copilot’s suggestions.
Challenge 2: Data Structure

Implement a Python class for a stack with push, pop, and is_empty methods.
Let Copilot assist by typing method names and comments.
Challenge 3: Optimisation

Create a function to check for anagrams between two strings.
Evaluate Copilot’s suggestions for efficiency and clarity.
Challenge 4: Error Handling

Write a program that opens a file, reads its contents, and handles file-not-found errors.
Visual Aid: Examples of Copilot suggestions for each challenge.

Part 4: Evaluating Copilot's Suggestions
Correctness

Review the logic of generated code against the problem requirements.
Add print statements or use PyCharm’s debugger to test functionality.
Efficiency

Assess performance, especially for algorithms. Refactor as needed for optimisation.
Readability

Ensure generated code aligns with Python coding standards (e.g., PEP 8).
Simplify or reformat suggestions for clarity.

Part 5: Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot
Use as a Collaborator: Treat Copilot as an assistant, not a replacement for understanding.
Verify Suggestions: Always test generated code for accuracy and efficiency.
Context Matters: Provide detailed comments or partial code to guide Copilot.
Stay Secure: Avoid using sensitive data in prompts to prevent unintended exposure.
Iterate: Refine suggestions by providing additional context or rejecting irrelevant outputs.
